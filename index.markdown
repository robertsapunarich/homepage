Hi,

My name's Robbie. I live in Charlottesville, VA. This is my home on the open web. 
You can find pictures, short form thoughts, and longer form writing here.
This site is currently under construction. I don't maintain any social media. 
If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me at robertsapunarich @ gmail dot com. 
As this is my personal space, any thoughts I publish here or elsewhere are solely mine, 
and do not express those of any employer with which I am affiliated.
